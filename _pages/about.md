I'm currently a Master's student at Georgia Tech with a specialization in Robotics and Perception. I am also an aspiring robotics engineer!

I'm super passionate how machines can be made intelligent and how they sense and interact with the world around them. I'm currently working on my Master's thesis, which involves using 2D endoscopic images to form an understanding of the colon and develop control algorithms for surgical robots based on analysis of these images.

I also just finished my second internship at Relativity Space (they 3D print rockets?!). I worked on the robotics software team, integrating sensors and developing control algorithms compatible with the real-time operating system that interfaces with the robot that does the 3D printing.
