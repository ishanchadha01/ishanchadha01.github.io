I'm currently a Robotics Engineer at Relativity Space, where I work on automating the construction of rockets via additive manufacturing.

I'm very passionate how machines can be made intelligent and how they sense and interact with the world around them. I just finished my Master's thesis, which involves using 2D endoscopic images to construct a 3D model of the colon in real-time, despite the textureless nature of such an environment.

I'm trying to use this website as my writing/notes outlet. Let's see how it goes!
