I created this website as a writing/notes outlet - let's see how that goes! Right now, I'm a Robotics Engineer at Relativity Space, where I work on everything from low-level embedded systems and real-time operating systems to high-level implicit neural models of large metal parts, and everything in-between that broadly falls into the domain of robotics.

I'm very passionate how machines can be made intelligent and how they sense and interact with the world around them. Last year, I finished my Master's thesis on 3D modeling of the colon in real-time with 2d endoscope images, despite the textureless nature of such an environment.

I hope my notes/posts can be of use/interesting to you! You can reach out to me at ishanchadha01@gmail.com with any questions or comments.
